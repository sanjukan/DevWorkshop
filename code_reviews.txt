1. Check out the code reviewer guidelines for software engineers at Yelp and Microsoft (Visual Studio Mobile team). What concepts are similar between the companies (List at least two)? What are some key differences (List at least two)? In general, what items should be present in a code review checklist for a development team?
  - In the two articles on code reviews, key similarities include the emphasis on effective communication and the shared responsibility of reviewers for code quality.

Overall, both stress the importance of timely, well-understood, and constructively reviewed code, guided by clear guidelines and a collaborative spirit for continuous improvement.

The next questions will require you to review code reviews on the Code Review Stack Exchange (https://codereview.stackexchange.com/) website, a Stack Overflow-like website for code reviews between peers online. To analyze reviews, you may use either of the code review guidelines above, another code review checklist online (cite the source), or your own personal knowledge, opinions, and experience.
